# AutoCheckin
Originally an auto-checkin script made for Genshin (and originally written in Python), rewritten in C#.
Intended to be included in a launch script (e.g. a batch file that launches Genshin, 3dmigoto, FPS unlocker, and whatever else you need)

Also, apparently, for some people the download gets marked as a virus... You can check the source if you're still unsure
